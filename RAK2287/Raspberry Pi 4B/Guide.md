# Set up helium DIY pi

## Image your Raspberry Pi microsd card
+ Download the Raspberry Pi OS 64 bit lite image
` http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_arm64/images/`

+ Flash it to your micro sd card using using a tool such as Etcher or Raspberry Pi imager.

+ Create new (empty) file on root of `boot` SD card called `ssh`

+ Add wifi login info if desired, add text file `wpa_supplicant.conf` to root of `boot` SD card.

```

## Set up Miner on Pi

Helium dele this Script! Annybody have it?
Source: https://developer.helium.com/blockchain/run-your-own-miner 

+ SSH into raspberry pi (if not already connected).
```console
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
```

+ Create directory for miner data
```console
mkdir ~/miner_data
```

+ Get the filename for the most recent version of the miner docker image from quay.io/team-helium/miner. Make sure to get the arm64 version for the pi. They are in the format `miner-xxxNN_YYYY.MM.DD` to the current one at the time of this document is `miner-arm64_2020.09.08.0_GA`.

+ This docker command will download docker image and set it to always start up. Be sure to swap out `miner-xxxNN_YYYY.MM.DD.0_GA` for the current image name. Make sure that REGION_OVERRIDE variable matches your region. 

```console
sudo docker run -d \
  --env REGION_OVERRIDE=US915 \
  --restart always \
  --publish 1680:1680/udp \
  --publish 44158:44158/tcp \
  --name miner \
  --mount type=bind,source=/home/pi/miner_data,target=/var/data \
  quay.io/team-helium/miner:miner-xxxNN_YYYY.MM.DD.0_GA
```

+ Verify that your container has started
```console
docker ps
```

For maxium effort, set up port forwards on your internet router to the pi. Outside port '44158/TCP' should forward to the internal IP of the pi.

## Set up Packet Forwarder

+ Make sure your are in your home directory
```console
cd ~
```
+ Clone the packet forwarer for sx1302 based gateways like the RAK2287
```console
git clone https://github.com/helium/sx1302_hal.git
```

+ Move to the project folder 
```console
cd sx1302_hal
```

+ If you do not want to have to put in your password a million times in the next step, you can create a ssh key in the sub steps below otherwise skip to the next step.
    - Create the ssh key pair.

    ```console
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
    ```
    Press enter three times to accept the defaults.

    - Set up your user to use the key pair.

    ```console
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pi@localhost
    ```
    You will need to enter your password.

+ Compile the project
```console
make clean all
```

+ Make the executables 
```console
make install
```

Note you can change parameters for this step in `target.cfg`

+ Install the config files 
```console
make install_conf
```

+ Move into bin directory 
```console
cd bin
```

+ Make a copy of the conf file for your reggion and name it as the default
```console
cp global_conf.json.sx1250.US915 global_conf.json
```

+ Add pi user to gpio group
```console
sudo usermod -aG gpio pi
```

+ Reboot for changes to take effect 
```console
sudo reboot
```

+ SSH back in to pi
```console
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
```

+ Move to lora packet folder bin directory
```console
cd sx1302_hal/bin
```

+ Test out the packet forwarder 
```console
./lora_pkt_fwd
```

+ Stop the packet forwarder by pressing CTRL-c


## Set up auto start scripts
Source: https://github.com/Lora-net/sx1302_hal/tree/master/tools/systemd

+ Create a systemd service script 
```console
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/lora_pkt_fwd.service
```

+ Paste the following into new text file:

```
[Unit]
Description=LoRa Packet Forwarder
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/sx1302_hal/bin
ExecStart=/home/pi/sx1302_hal/bin/lora_pkt_fwd -c /home/pi/sx1302_hal/bin/global_conf.json
Restart=always
RestartSec=30
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=lora_pkt_fwd
User=pi

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

+ Save the file by pressing CTRL-X, and then Y, and then Enter to save changes

+ Reload the daemon 

```console
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

+ Enable the service 

```console
sudo systemctl enable lora_pkt_fwd.service
```

### The following commands to disable the service, manually start/stop it and check status:

```console
sudo systemctl disable lora_pkt_fwd.service
```

```console
sudo systemctl start lora_pkt_fwd.service
```

```console
sudo systemctl stop lora_pkt_fwd.service
```

```console
sudo systemctl status lora_pkt_fwd.service
```

### Configure rsyslog to redirect the packet forwarder logs into a dedicated file

```console
sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.d/lora_pkt_fwd.conf
```

+ Paste the following into the text editor:
```
if $programname == 'lora_pkt_fwd' then /var/log/lora_pkt_fwd.log
if $programname == 'lora_pkt_fwd' then ~
```

+ Save the file by pressing CTRL-X, and then Y, and then Enter to save changes

+ Restart the rsyslog service

```console
sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
```

+ Reboot for changes to take affect.

```console
sudo reboot
```

### See the Lora Packet Forwarder logs

```console
tail /var/log/lora_pkt_fwd.log
```
## Optional - Set up Miner autoupdate script
Source: https://github.com/Wheaties466/helium_miner_scripts

+ Clone miner auto update script repo
```console
git clone https://github.com/Wheaties466/helium_miner_scripts.git
```

+ CD into directory
```console
cd helium_miner_scripts/
```

+ Make scripte executable
```console
chmod +x miner_latest.sh
```

+ Make the log file
```console
sudo touch /var/log/miner_latest.log
```

+ By default the script is configured for US915 frequencies. To use the miner in other regios like EU868 the script shall be changed by adding the --env REGION_OVERRIDE=EU868 to the line with docker run.

+ Run the script
```console
./miner_latest.sh
```

+ Configure cron to run the script daily
```console
sudo crontab -e
```

+ Choose "1" to make nano your editor of choice.

+ Add the following at the end of the text editor.

```
# Check for updates on miner image
# Use whatever path you have your repo setup with.
# If you need to test your cron you can use the following site and add "&& curl -s 'https://webhook.site/#!/~'" to the end of your cron and it will make a web request to your specific url when it completes.
0 */4 * * * /home/pi/helium_miner_scripts/miner_latest.sh >> /var/log/miner_latest.log
```

+ Save the file by pressing CTRL-X, and then Y, and then Enter to save changes
